    <h1>Welcome! In order to play Rock Paper Scissor, please open the browser's console!</h1>
    <p>This game will be updated in the future to make it more user friendly but for now it's played through the browser's console because that's how my assignment told me to make it. </p>
    <p>How to Inspect Elements. To inspect elements you have to right-click any part of a webpage and click Inspect > Inspect Element. Alternatively, you can press Command+Option+i on your Mac or F12 on your PC to do the same. Every modern web browser has a native tool for inspecting elements. Select "Console" next to "Element"!</p>
